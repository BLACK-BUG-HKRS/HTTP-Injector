# HTTP-Injector
HTTP responses injector!

to run this:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you want to sniff locally, you can directly run:

```
python dochttp.py --show-raw
```

If you want to sniff http packets in the network, you gonna need the man-in-the-middle (MITM) using ARP spoofing, then you run the script.

You will find ARP spoofer and how to use it [here](https://github.com/BLACK-BUG-HKRS/ARP-spoofer)
